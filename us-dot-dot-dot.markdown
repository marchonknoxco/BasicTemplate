<h3 style="text-align: left;">Derrin</h3>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Derrin gets things done. She&rsquo;s passionate, outgoing, and not afraid of the rain. Derrin is fearless, and she speaks up.</p>
<h3>Emily</h3>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Emily uses the Resistance as a way of coping with the political <em>Twilight Zone</em> we find ourselves in. She has two kids, she is addicted to the news, and she uses a lot of exclamation points when she writes.</p>
<h3>Hilary</h3>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Hilary is the nice one. She&rsquo;ll hear you out and help you out. Want something on our radar? She&rsquo;s the one to talk to.</p>
<h3>Katya</h3>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Katya celebrates every success: large, small; personal, political. She writes poetry and fights the regime.</p>
<h3>Mary Jane</h3>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">MJ knows everything and everyone. She is our girl on the ground, and nothing happens unless she makes it happen.</p>
