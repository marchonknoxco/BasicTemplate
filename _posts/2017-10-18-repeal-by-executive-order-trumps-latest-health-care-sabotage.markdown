  Caller: Good morning/afternoon! Can you let me know Representative/Senator _____’s position on the bipartisan efforts to stabilize the health insurance markets?
  OPTION 1: SUPPORTS

  Staffer: Thank you for calling. Representative/Senator ______ supports Senator Murray and Senator Alexander’s efforts to stabilize the markets, and hopes they can reach an agreement that will keep costs down for consumers.

  Caller: I’m glad to hear it, but the deal Senators Murray and Alexander were discussing isn’t enough after Trump’s latest round of sabotage. His latest executive order will cause a death spiral unless Congress acts. I want Representative/Senator _____ to commit to supporting a stabilization bill that will both guarantee the CSR payments, and close loopholes that allow association health plans and short-term plans to offer inadequate coverage.

  Staffer: I will pass along your thoughts to the Representative/Senator.

  Caller: Please do. This is very important to me, and I will be watching to ensure the Representative/Senator protects care for all Americans.

On October 12, Trump issued an executive order designed to destabilize health care markets, and followed that up with another announcement that will lead to higher premiums and more uninsured Americans. The first order directed various agencies to expand the availability of low-quality plans that do not offer the same critical protections as other plans under the Affordable Care Act; the second fulfilled Trump’s long-running threat to cut off cost-sharing reduction (CSR) payments, which will cause the cost of coverage to spike for millions of Americans. Ask your Members of Congress to stop Trump’s sabotage of the ACA: ensure that all health plans have guaranteed protections and that CSR payments continue. 

Democrats have been negotiating with Republicans on a bipartisan “stabilization bill” that would include a guarantee that CSR payments continue. But merely guaranteeing those payments is not enough. Ask your MoCs to ensure that the bipartisan bill continues protections for people enrolled in association health plans, that short-term plans stay truly short-term, and that CSR payments continue.
