  Caller: Hi! My name is [name] and I’m a constituent calling from [part of state]. I’m calling because I’m concerned about Trump’s wide-ranging surveillance authority, and I want to urge Senator/Representative [name] not to reauthorize Section 702 of the FISA Amendments at the end of the year without closing the “backdoor search” loophole. In support of this reform, Senator/Representative should cosponsor the bipartisan USA RIGHTS Act from [for Senate: Senators Wyden and Paul, for House: Representatives Lofgren and Poe].

  Staffer: Thank you for your concern. The [Member] is taking a look at a number of options, but wants to be sure to preserve our intelligence-gathering capabilities for the fight against ISIS and other threats.

  Caller: I also want our intelligence community to be able to gather information on threats, but my concern is that current surveillance authority and practice - especially “backdoor searches” - go far beyond that goal, and allows the U.S. government to collect Americans’ communications and use it against them without a warrant.

  Staffer: We’ll take a look at that, and I’ll relay your concerns to the [Member].

  Caller: Please do - at a minimum, Congress should close the so-called “backdoor search” loophole which allows the FBI to search through collected data for Americans’ communications without a warrant. This is unconstitutional and makes us less safe, particular placing vulnerable communities at risk. If Congress isn’t going to make that reform, they should let Section 702 expire.

  Staffer: Thank you for relaying your concerns to us.

  Caller: Thanks—I’ll be monitoring the [Member]’s vote on this, and whether [he/she] co-sponsors the USA RIGHTS Act.

A key part of the Trump administration’s surveillance authority is set to expire at the end of 2017, unless Congress reauthorizes it. Every Member of Congress is going to have to decide whether to protect Americans’ privacy, or to leave unconstitutional spying authority in Trump’s hands.

No president should be afforded such a powerful tool—especially Trump. The U.S. government is no stranger to abusing its surveillance powers, and has a history of particularly targeting activists and marginalized communities. Trump has repeatedly threatened these groups and others, and displayed willingness to violate rights under the guise of “security.” Extending his surveillance authority would only give him one more tool to abuse, and make us less safe.

Unless there are meaningful reforms to protect Americans against unlawful surveillance, Congress shouldn’t reauthorize Trump’s spying authority under Section 702 of the FISA Amendments Act.
