<p>We designed these things just in case you want them. <strong>**All items are sold at cost.**</strong> We happen to think the stuff is cool, but we&rsquo;re partial.</p>
<p>Neither March On: Indivisible, its organizers, nor the national Indivisible group earns any money from these sales. You're just paying for the thing. <strong>No profit here.</strong></p>
<p>All designs are available in all styles and colors. Also--mugs, kids' clothes, and bags. (One of us likes to design t-shirts in her spare time. Claims it is relaxing.)</p>
