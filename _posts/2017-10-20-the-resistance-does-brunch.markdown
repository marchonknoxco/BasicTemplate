**Budgets! DACA! Health care! Iran! And that wall … **

Laid back and over coffee and eggs, our Brunch meetings are on the fourth Saturday of every month. We will review the issues covered during the Thursday evening meeting--they're the second Thursday of every month--and catch up on what’s happened in the meantime.

We’ll talk about what Congress up to and go over some Indivisible strategies. We’ll also talk about what issues are most important to everybody here and what we can do about them locally, state-wide, and at the federal level. 

Come one, come all. **Everyone is welcome, no matter your political persuasion. As always, take what you like and leave the rest.**

Come late or leave early if you need to. And there's no need to spend money, if you’ve just come from breakfast elsewhere or if you’ve got other plans for lunch. If you can’t make it, no problem--we’ll catch you next time. Next second Thursday or next fourth Saturday, maybe.

The Broadview is a low-key greasy spoon kind of place–-exactly the kind of place for eating pancakes and bacon. It’s seat yourself, so just wander toward the left and then to the back. We’ll be the folks with pieces of paper, and we’ll either be laughing or scowling, depending on the conversation.

**Let’s happen to things!**
