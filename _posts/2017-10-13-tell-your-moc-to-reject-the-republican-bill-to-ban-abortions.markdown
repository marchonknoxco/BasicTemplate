Republican Members of Congress (MoCs) are continuing their radical attacks on reproductive rights by moving forward with a bill that blocks access to abortions before most women even know they’re pregnant.  The House Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution and Civil Justice scheduled a hearing for November 1, 2017 to discuss the Heartbeat Protection Act of 2017 (H.R. 490).

The “Heartbeat Bill” effectively bans all abortions starting six weeks into a pregnancy by making it a crime for a physician to knowingly perform an abortion without determining "whether the fetus has a detectable heartbeat," "without informing the mother of the results," or "after determining that a fetus has a detectable heartbeat." The sole exception to the ban is for an abortion which is medically necessary to save the life of the woman—ignoring a woman’s psychological state, even in instances of rape or incest.

Your MoC needs to hear from you that the Heartbeat Bill is a horrifying, extreme attack on reproductive health and a woman’s right to choose. Tell your MoC to stand up for women and families, and oppose the Heartbeat Bill.
