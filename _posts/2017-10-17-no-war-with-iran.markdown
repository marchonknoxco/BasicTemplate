  Caller: Hello, I’m a constituent from [part of state] and I’m very concerned about the Iran deal. Trump foolishly decertified it even though Iran is complying and it’s keeping us all safe. It’s up to Congress now—will [MoC] commit not to reimpose sanctions that would kill the deal and risk war with Iran?

  Staffer: Thank you for sharing those concerns. [MoC] is considering [his/her] options right now. [He/she] thinks the deal could be changed slightly and is open to that.

  Caller: That’s not acceptable. Our international partners tell us the deal is the deal and there will be no renegotiations. Either we are in or we are out, and if we’re out, we will go to war with Iran. Will [MoC] make sure this doesn’t happen?

  Staffer: I hear your concern. [MoC] is also concerned because Iran is a state sponsor of terrorism and commits a lot of human rights abuses. Plus they are hostile to us, our ally Israel, and others.

  Caller: This is exactly why we can’t let them have a nuclear weapon—which they will, if this deal falls apart. It is crucial for [MoC] to stand up to Trump on this and keep us safe. We can’t have another North Korea.

  Staffer: I’ll certainly relay your concerns to [MoC].

  Caller: Yes, please do. I consider a vote to re-impose sanctions as a vote for war with Iran, and I will be watching closely to make sure [MoC] does not let that happen.

Trump announced on October 13, 2017 that he is decertifying the Iran nuclear deal. He is supposed to certify every 90 days that Iran is complying with the deal, but even though international inspectors and his own national security officials say that Iran is complying with the deal, Trump is decertifying it anyway.

Congress can act now to prevent this. In the next 60 days, Congress could use an expedited procedure to re-impose sanctions, effectively killing the deal. They only need 51 votes in the Senate, not 60, to accomplish this.

Make no mistake: a vote to kill the deal is a vote for war with Iran.

Every single senator will be responsible for deciding whether the U.S. follows Trump into an unnecessary new war, or decides to keep relying on a diplomatic solution that verifiably works and makes us all safer.

Congress needs to hear from you today. Call them immediately and ask all your MoCs to commit not to re-impose sanctions and take us to war with Iran.
