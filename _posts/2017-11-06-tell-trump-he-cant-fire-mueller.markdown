  Caller: Hi! I’m a constituent from [part of state] I’m calling to urge [MoC] to use every tool in the toolbox to prevent Trump from firing Special Counsel Mueller. I’m concerned he may do that, launching a constitutional crisis. Will [MoC] speak out and tell the President that firing Mueller would be a red line he must not cross?

  Staffer: Thank you for your call. [MoC] is monitoring the various investigations closely and is letting them run their course.

  Caller: That’s good, but it’s really important for Congress to assert its power now to prevent Trump from firing Mueller. I’d like to see [MoC] issue a clear statement on this, and co-sponsor [H.R. 3771/S. 1735 or S. 1741] to show [his/her] support for protecting Mueller and the investigation.

  Staffer: We’ll take a look at that legislation.

  Caller: Great, I’ll be following to see if [MoC] co-sponsors and speaks out on this.

[Ask Congress to prevent Mueller from getting fired. ](https://www.indivisible.org/resource/protecting-democracy-cant-fire-mueller/)

It is the duty of Congress, as a separate co-equal branch of government, to guard against abuses of the Executive Branch. That’s why the framers of the Constitution created separation of powers. Our elected officials need to speak out and make clear that firing Mueller would be a red line that Trump must not cross. Senators can co-sponsor legislation to protect against a Mueller firing: S. 1735 led by Senators Graham and Booker, and S. 1741 led by Senators Coons and Tillis. Representatives in the House can co-sponsor H.R. 3771, led by Representatives Jones and Conyers.
