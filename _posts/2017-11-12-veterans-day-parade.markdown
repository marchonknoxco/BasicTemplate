Okay!!

If you want to cheer with us at the Veterans Day parade this afternoon, we'll be meeting at the **SE corner of Cherry and Main St.**

**We'll meet around 1:45**, and we'll be wearing very warm coats. 

Want to make a sign? How about "Vets protect Free Speech," "We, the people!" or "Resistance is Patriotic!"?
