  * Heads up: MoC means "Member of Congress." (Also, you can find more background on the issue [here](https://www.indivisible.org/resource/preventing-gun-violence-tell-members-congress-prayers-not-enough/).)

  Caller: Hello, I’m a constituent from [part of state] calling regarding the mass shooting in Las Vegas. I urge Senator/Representative [name] to not just condemn this act of terror, but to support responsible policies that help prevent these acts of gun violence.

  Staffer: Thank you for calling, [MoC] has issued a statement condemning this attack, extending thoughts and prayers, and is listening for more information about the incident.

  Caller: I’m glad to hear that, but we also need to see [MoC] taking action to prevent our current gun laws from being gutted. The House will soon consider a provision in the SHARE Act that makes it easy for dangerous people to acquire silencers for their guns. Would [MoC] support removing this provision?

  Staffer: We’ll have to take a look at the specific language, but [MoC] is a defender of the constitutional right to bear arms.

  Caller: This legislation does not infringe upon that right and removing the silencer provision would simply ensure that current law—that has been in place for decades—remains on the books. Silencers distort the sound of gunfire, making it harder for victims to flee and first responders to intervene. In the wake of the tragedy in Vegas, it is essential for Congress to support removing the silencer provision from the SHARE Act.

  Staffer: I’ll certainly relay these concerns to the [MoC].

  Caller: Thank you, please do, I will be closely monitoring [his/her] action on this.

Late in the evening of October 1, a shooter opened fire on a crowd gathered for a concert in Las Vegas. This act of terror, inflicted by a single individual, killed at least 50 people and wounded at least 500. We stand in solidarity with, and extend our warmest comfort to, all impacted by this horrific terrorist attack. Donald Trump and all U.S. officials must condemn this violence in the same way they would condemn a shooter of color—and call it what it is: terrorism.

It’s not nearly enough, but the very least that Congress can do right now to protect against gun violence is to strip the silencer provision out of the SHARE Act. As we mourn the violence in Vegas, call your MoCs right now and tell them that “thoughts and prayers” are not enough. Demand that they oppose the silencer provision.
