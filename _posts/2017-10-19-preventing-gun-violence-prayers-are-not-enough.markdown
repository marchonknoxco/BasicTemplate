call-script-text: "Caller: Hello! My name is [ ] and I’m calling from [part of state].
  I’m calling to ask that the [MoC] support reauthorization of the Children’s Health
  Insurance Program immediately, using a bipartisan approach.\n\nStaffer: Thanks for
  calling. [MoC] is strongly supportive of CHIP.\n\nCaller: Thank you. Our state runs
  out of funding [check the map above] so it’s really important that Congress do this
  immediately. I appreciate [MoC]’s support.\n\nStaffer: Thanks. I can pass your thoughts
  on to the [MoC].\n\nCaller: Thank you very much and thank you for your support. "

Late in the evening of October 1, a shooter opened fire on a crowd gathered for a concert in Las Vegas. This act of terror, inflicted by a single individual, killed at least 50 people and wounded at least 500. We stand in solidarity with, and extend our warmest comfort to, all impacted by this horrific terrorist attack. Donald Trump and all U.S. officials must condemn this violence in the same way they would condemn a shooter of color—and call it what it is: terrorism.

It’s not nearly enough, but the very least that Congress can do right now to protect against gun violence is to strip the silencer provision out of the SHARE Act. As we mourn the violence in Vegas, call your MoCs right now and tell them that “thoughts and prayers” are not enough. Demand that they oppose the silencer provision.
