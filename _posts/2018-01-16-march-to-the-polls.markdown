**We are the leaders we have been waiting for.​**

On January 21, 2018, Women’s March will gather in Las Vegas, Nevada for Women's March: Power to the Polls, an event that will launch a national voter registration tour one year after the historic Women’s March on Washington. This next stage of the movement will channel the energy and activism of the Women's March into tangible strategies and concrete wins in 2018.

The national voter registration tour will target swing states to register new voters, engage impacted communities, harness our collective energy to advocate for policies and candidates that reflect our values, and collaborate with our partners to elect more women and progressives candidates to office. The coordinated campaign will build upon Women’s March’s ongoing work uplifting the voices and campaigns of the nation’s most marginalized communities to create transformative social and political change.

On the heels of the Women’s Convention, which brought over 5,000 activists and future leaders to Detroit, and with November’s sweeping victories--from the first openly transgender woman of color winning an election to public office, to the first Asian American woman elected to the Virginia House of Delegates, to first Sikh American to be elected mayor of the city, to the first-ever Latina women elected to the Virginia House of Delegates, to seven cities electing their first Black mayors, and so many more--Women’s March aims to convert the groundswell of momentum and activism into direct electoral power.

**The rise of the woman is the rise of the nation.**
