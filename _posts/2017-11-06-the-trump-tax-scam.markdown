call-script-text: Hi, I'm [NAME], a constituent calling from [CITY, ZIP]. I'm calling
  about the partisan tax reform plan. I am staunchly opposed to this plan. The proposed
  tax cuts will mostly benefit the rich at the expense of programs that the working
  poor and middle-class depend on like Medicaid, Medicare, and Social Security. Please
  tell Senator/Representative [NAME] that constituents want Congress to work on tax
  reform by following regular legislative order. We need committee hearings and bipartisan
  cooperation. It's not fair to pass major changes to the tax code using the budget
  reconciliation process. Please pass along my comments and follow up with me at [CONTACT
  INFO]. Thank you so much for taking my call.

[We know this plan is a scam.](https://www.indivisible.org/resource/trump-tax-scam-happens-next/) 

By now it should come as no surprise that Trump can’t keep the promises he’s making to the middle class. And for the most part, the Trump Tax Scam doesn’t even try to keep his promises.

The Trump Tax Scam would give massive tax cuts to the wealthy. It’s designed that way: it lowers the tax rate for wealthy individuals and phases out or outright repeals other provisions, like the estate tax and the alternative minimum tax. That only benefits the wealthy because those taxes only affect the wealthy—and there’s nothing that benefits the middle class that isn’t wiped out by some other change the Tax Scam makes.

Just as bad, the Trump Tax Scam makes existing racial inequality even worse. The majority of the benefits of the Trump Tax Scam flow to the top 1%—a slice of the population that is 82% white but only 3% Black and 5% Latino.
