**Budgets! DACA! Health care! Iran! And that wall …**

Laid back and over pizza, our Thursday meetings are on the second Thursday of every month. We will review the issues covered during the Brunch meeting--they're the fourth Saturday of every month--and catch up on what’s happened in the meantime.

We’ll talk about what Congress up to and go over some Indivisible strategies. We’ll also talk about what issues are most important to everybody here and what we can do about them locally, state-wide, and at the federal level. 

Come one, come all. **Everyone is welcome, no matter your political persuasion. As always, take what you like and leave the rest.**

Come late or leave early if you need to. And there's no need to spend money, if you’ve got other plans for dinner. If you can’t make it, no problem--we’ll catch you next time. Next second Thursday or next fourth Saturday, maybe.

Budde’s is a low-key pizza joint attached to a low-key bar. We’ll be on the pizza side, but if you find yourself in the bar, just wander toward the back and take a left. We’re the folks with pieces of paper, and we’ll either be laughing or scowling, depending on the conversation.

**Let’s happen to things!**
