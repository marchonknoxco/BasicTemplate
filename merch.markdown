We designed these things just in case you want them. (Also, one of us likes to design t-shirts in her spare time. Claims it is relaxing.) 

**All items are sold at cost.** Neither March On: Indivisible, its organizers, nor the national Indivisible group earns any money from these sales. *No* portion of your purchase does goes to the artist. **No profit here.**

All designs are available in all styles and colors. Also--mugs, kids' clothes, and bags. We happen to think the stuff is cool, but weâ€™re partial.
