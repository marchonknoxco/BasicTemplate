We designed these things just in case you want them. (Also, one of us likes to design mugs and t-shirts in her spare time. Claims it is relaxing.) 

If you decide to buy stuff, you should know that **no** money goes to the artist, the group, the organization, anybody. There's no financial benefit, no profit. You're just paying for the stuff.

We do think the designs are cool, but we're partial.
