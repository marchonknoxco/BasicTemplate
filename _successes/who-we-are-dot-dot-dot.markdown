Derrin
> Derrin makes thing happen. She's passionate, outgoing, and not afraid of the rain. Derrin can also hold her own.
Emily
> Emily uses the Resistance as a way to cope with the political Twilight Zone we find ourselves in. She has two kids, she is addicted to the news, and she uses a lot of exclamation points.
Hilary
> Hilary is the nice one. She'll hear you out and help you out. Want something on our radar? She's the one you want.
Katya
> Katya celebrates every success: large, small; personal, political. She writes poetry and fights the regime. 
Mary Jane
> MJ knows everything and everyone. She is our girl on the ground, and nothing happens unless she makes it happen.
